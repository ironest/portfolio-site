## Description

This repository contains my first professional online portfolio; it also serves as a diary to describe the process I followed to gather ideas, information and the actual steps I went through to create the website (design, planning, execution).

### Purpose

**The most important** aspect of having an online portfolio, is to show my expertise and showcase my work. It could also be beneficial in making a good impression to potential employers.
**Secondly**, it is desirable to have (or increase) an online presence so that, whoever looks up my name on a searching engine (e.g. google) my portfolio pops up. This will help me expanding my network and to develop my personal brand.
**Lastly**, with just a URL, I can infinitely extend my resume, adding as much content as I want, shaping it in whatever creative way I prefer, stepping outside of the traditional/boring/conservative plain PDF (or piece of paper).

### Functionality / features

  * Responsive Design
  * Carousel of my working experience
  * Blog post preview 
  * Fade-In animation of elements outside the viewport
  * Fixed Navigation bar (in progress)
  * World of Warcraft theme (available as a separete branch)
  
### Sitemap

The portfolio website is made of 4 webpages with landing page represented by the index.html which also serves as "About Me".
From there, any other webpage is reacheable through the navigation bar.

### Target audience

My portfolio audience can be broken down into the following categories:
 * Potential employers
 * Internship providers
 * Peers such as:
    * Project Collaborators
    * Classmates
    * Friends & Family

As of now (September 2019) the website is only available in english language; as a consequence, the target audience is limited to English speakers but, due to my strong Italian roots, in future I could implement a parallel version for Italian speakers. No other demographics discrimination of age, gender, ability, sexual orientation, race or religion.

### Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)

The process involved using the following tools/tech:

  * **Design**
     * Balsamiq Mockups
     * Adobe Photoshop

  * **Development**
     * HTML
     * CSS
     * Javascript (pure vanilla)

  * **Deployment**
     * Git 
     * GitHub
     * Netlify

## Project Management

### Wireframes

The process used to create the portfolio project followed the approach defined as "Mobile First".
This is a popular trend within the UX design and development communities. In short, the paradigm means designing a site (or an app) for mobile before designing it for the desktop Webâ€”or any other device.

While implementing below wireframes, I made large use of the FLEXBOX layout which ended up being the best choice as it gave my containers the ability to alter their width/height (and order) to best fill the available space. Due to this great advantage, after finishing the mobile implementation, I did not have to go through any wireframe design for the desktop media.

### Trello

Day 1 (17 September 2019)
This was the official project start date; I spent few hours assembling requirements and ideas around the main objective:
  * index page could be a summary, or about me
  * Projects or work experience or studies/education
  * Blog with at least 5 sample posts (placeholder text can be used), blog posts need to have at least ONE image each
  * A contact page with a big form taking the majority of the page
